# Introduction to Offensive Security

**Offensive Security** refers to the proactive and strategic practice of simulating cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities in an organization's digital infrastructure, applications, or processes. Unlike **defensive security**, which focuses on protecting systems from potential threats, offensive security emphasizes finding weaknesses before attackers exploit them.

## Key Objectives of Offensive Security

- **Identify Vulnerabilities**  
  Proactively discover and address security flaws in networks, systems, and applications.

- **Test Defenses**  
  Assess the effectiveness of an organization's security measures under simulated attack scenarios.

- **Strengthen Security Posture**  
  Help organizations understand and mitigate risks by implementing better security practices.

- **Prevent Real Attacks**  
  By thinking and acting like an attacker, organizations can stay ahead of evolving threats.
