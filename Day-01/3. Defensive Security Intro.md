# 🛡️ Defensive Security – An Introduction  

## 📌 What is Defensive Security?  
**Defensive Security** is a branch of cybersecurity focused on **protecting systems, networks, and data** from cyber threats. Unlike **offensive 
security**, which involves ethical hacking and penetration testing, defensive security aims to **detect, prevent, and mitigate attacks** before they 
cause harm.  

---

## 🔍 Why is Defensive Security Important?  
- 🚫 **Prevents unauthorized access** to sensitive information.  
- 🔎 **Detects and mitigates threats** before they escalate.  
- 🛡️ **Protects organizations** from cyberattacks, data breaches, and malware.  
- 📜 **Ensures compliance** with security regulations (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001, NIST).

## 🔹 Key Components of Defensive Security  

### 1️⃣ **Network Security**  
🔹 Uses firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (**IDS/IPS**), and network segmentation to secure data flow.  

### 2️⃣ **Endpoint Security**  
🔹 Protects devices (laptops, servers, mobile phones) using **antivirus software, EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response), and patch management**.  

### 3️⃣ **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  
🔹 Enforces **least privilege access**, multi-factor authentication (**MFA**), and role-based access controls (**RBAC**).  

### 4️⃣ **Threat Intelligence & Monitoring**  
🔹 Uses **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** tools to detect anomalies and analyze logs.  

### 5️⃣ **Security Awareness Training**  
🔹 Educates employees on phishing, social engineering, and safe browsing practices.  

### 6️⃣ **Incident Response & Recovery**  
🔹 Defines steps to **detect, contain, eradicate, and recover** from security incidents.

## 🚀 Best Practices in Defensive Security  

✔ **Use the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** – Restrict user access to only what is necessary.  
✔ **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Adds an extra layer of protection.  
✔ **Implement Firewalls & IDS/IPS** – Monitors and filters network traffic for threats.  
✔ **Keep Systems Updated & Patched** – Prevents exploitation of known vulnerabilities.  
✔ **Perform Regular Security Audits & Penetration Tests** – Identifies weak points in security.  
✔ **Monitor Logs & Use SIEM Tools** – Detects anomalies and suspicious activity.
