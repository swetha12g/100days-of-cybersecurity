# 🔐 Introduction to Security Operations  

## 📌 What is Security Operations?  
**Security Operations (SecOps)** refers to the continuous monitoring, detection, and response to **cyber threats** to protect an organization’s infrastructure, data, and users. It involves a dedicated **Security Operations Center (SOC)** where security analysts and engineers work to prevent, detect, and mitigate security incidents.  

---

## 🔹 Why is Security Operations Important?  
- 🛡 **Prevents cyber threats** such as malware, ransomware, and insider attacks.  
- 🔍 **Detects and responds** to security incidents in real time.  
- 🚨 **Minimizes damage** from cyberattacks and ensures business continuity.  
- 🔐 **Ensures compliance** with security regulations (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001, NIST).

# 🏢 Practical Example of a Security Operations Center (SOC)  

## 📌 What is a SOC?  
A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized team responsible for **monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding** to cybersecurity threats in real time. It operates **24/7** to protect an organization's systems, data, and users from cyberattacks.  

---

## 🔍 Practical Example: Handling a Phishing Attack  

### **Scenario:**  
A company's **SOC analysts detect suspicious emails** being sent to employees, attempting to steal login credentials (**phishing attack**).  

### **SOC Response Steps:**  

| **Step** | **Action Taken** |
|---------|----------------|
| **1️⃣ Detection** | The SIEM system alerts analysts about multiple employees receiving phishing emails. |
| **2️⃣ Investigation** | SOC analysts examine the email headers, links, and attachments for malicious content. |
| **3️⃣ Containment** | The email domain is blocked, and employees are alerted to avoid clicking links. |
| **4️⃣ Eradication** | Compromised accounts are reset, and email filters are updated to prevent future attacks. |
| **5️⃣ Recovery** | Impacted systems are scanned for malware, and logs are reviewed for further threats. |
| **6️⃣ Lessons Learned** | A security awareness training session is conducted to educate employees on phishing threats. |
