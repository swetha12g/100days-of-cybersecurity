# 📡 HTTP Requests & Responses  

## 📌 Introduction  
The **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** follows a **request-response** model, which is the foundation of communication between clients (browsers, APIs) and web servers. 

- The **client** (e.g., a browser or API) **sends a request** for a resource (e.g., a webpage, image, or data).  
- The **server** processes the request and **sends back a response** with the requested content or an error message.

## 📨 HTTP Requests  

### **1️⃣ Structure of an HTTP Request**  
An HTTP request consists of three main components:  

1. **Request Line** – Contains the **HTTP method**, **URL**, and **protocol version**.  
2. **Headers** – Metadata about the request (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Content-Type`, `Authorization`).  
3. **Body** *(optional)* – Contains data in **POST, PUT, PATCH** requests (e.g., form data, JSON).  

📌 **Example of an HTTP GET Request:**  
```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1  
Host: example.com  
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0  
Accept: text/html
```

---

✅ The client requests index.html from example.com using HTTP/1.1.

📌 **Example of an HTTP POST Request (With Body):**

```
POST /login HTTP/1.1  
Host: example.com  
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
Content-Length: 32  

username=admin&password=secure123  

```
✅ The client submits login credentials to the server.

📩 HTTP Responses
2️⃣ Structure of an HTTP Response
An HTTP response consists of:

Status Line – Contains the HTTP version, status code, and status message.
Headers – Metadata about the response (e.g., Content-Type, Cache-Control).
Body (optional) – Contains the requested resource (e.g., HTML, JSON, images).

📌 **Example of an HTTP Response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
Date: Sat, 10 Feb 2025 12:00:00 GMT  
Server: Apache/2.4.41  
Content-Type: text/html  
Content-Length: 150  

<html>  
  <body>  
    <h1>Welcome to Example.com!</h1>  
  </body>  
</html>  

```

✅ The server returns a 200 OK response with an HTML page.
