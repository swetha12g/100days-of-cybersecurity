## 🔹 What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's browser by a website.  
They help websites remember user preferences, authentication details, and tracking information.

## 📌 Types of Cookies

| **Type**               | **Description** |
|------------------------|----------------|
| **Session Cookies**    | Temporary cookies that expire when the browser is closed. |
| **Persistent Cookies** | Stored on the device for a specified time even after closing the browser. |
| **Secure Cookies**     | Only transmitted over HTTPS to enhance security. |
| **HTTP-Only Cookies**  | Prevent JavaScript access to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. |
| **SameSite Cookies**   | Restrict cross-site request sharing for security. |

## 🔹 What Are Web Sessions?
A web session is a temporary interaction between a client (browser) and a server.  
It is used to maintain user state and activities during their visit.

## 🔑 How Sessions Work

1. **User Logs In** → Server creates a unique session ID.  
2. **Session ID Stored** → Typically stored in a cookie.  
3. **User Navigates** → Server recognizes the user based on the session ID.  
4. **Session Ends** → Expires after inactivity or logout.

## 📌 Key Differences: Cookies vs. Sessions

| **Feature**           | **Cookies**                                | **Sessions**                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Storage Location** | Browser                         | Server                         |
| **Lifespan**        | Can persist for long durations  | Ends when user logs out or times out |
| **Security**        | Can be stolen (if not secured)  | More secure (server-side)      |
| **Usage**          | Tracking, preferences           | Authentication, user-specific data |

## 🚀 Best Practices for Secure Cookies & Sessions

✔️ Use **HTTPS** to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  
✔️ Set **Secure** & **HTTP-Only** attributes for sensitive cookies.  
✔️ Implement **SameSite** to prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.  
✔️ Use short **session lifetimes** and refresh tokens where needed.
