# 🌐 HTTP Methods

HTTP methods (also called HTTP verbs) define the actions that can be performed on a resource. They are a fundamental part of **RESTful APIs** and web communication.

## 📌 Common HTTP Methods

| Method  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **GET**    | Retrieves data from a server (e.g., fetching a webpage). It should **not** modify any data. |
| **POST**   | Submits new data to a server (e.g., form submission, creating a new resource). |
| **PUT**    | Updates or replaces an existing resource with new data. |
| **PATCH**  | Partially updates an existing resource without replacing it entirely. |
| **DELETE** | Removes a resource from the server. |
| **HEAD**   | Similar to `GET`, but only retrieves headers without the response body. |
| **OPTIONS** | Returns the allowed HTTP methods for a resource (useful for CORS and security checks). |
| **TRACE**  | Echoes back the request for testing and debugging. |
| **CONNECT** | Establishes a **tunnel** to a server (mainly used for proxies and HTTPS requests). |

## 🚀 Key Differences

| Feature     | GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | DELETE |
|------------|-----|------|-----|-------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Read | Create | Replace | Modify | Remove |
| **Idempotent?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Safe?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Has Request Body?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

**Idempotent** → Sending multiple requests has the **same** result.  
**Safe** → Does **not** modify server data.
