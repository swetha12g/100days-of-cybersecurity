what is networking? 

Networking refers to the practice of connecting multiple devices, such as computers, servers, routers, and other hardware, in order to share data, resources, and services. The goal of networking is to enable communication between devices and to allow them to exchange information over various distances, whether locally (within a single building or campus) or globally (across the internet).



what is internet?

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other to share information, resources, and services. It allows devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets to connect with each other through a vast infrastructure of cables, wireless signals, and satellites.



Identifying Devices on a Network

Identifying devices on a network refers to the process of discovering and recognizing all the devices that are connected to a specific network. This is crucial for network management, troubleshooting, and security purposes. By identifying devices on a network, administrators can ensure that only authorized devices are connected, monitor network performance, and prevent potential security threats.

Here are some methods and concepts involved in identifying devices on a network:

1. IP Addressing

Each device on a network is typically assigned a unique IP (Internet Protocol) address. This address is used to identify the device and allows it to send and receive data on the network. There are two types of IP addresses commonly used:

IPv4: A 32-bit address written as four numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

IPv6: A newer, 128-bit address designed to replace IPv4, written in hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

Network administrators can identify devices by scanning the IP addresses in a network's address range.

2. MAC Address

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique hardware identifier assigned to network interfaces (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet cards) on devices. Unlike an IP address, the MAC address is embedded into the hardware and doesn't change. It is often used in local area networks (LANs) for device identification.

Example: 00:14:22:01:23:45.



What is Ping?

Ping is a simple network utility used to test the connectivity between two devices on a network. It helps determine if one device (like your computer or smartphone) can successfully communicate with another device (such as a server or another computer) over the network.



How Ping Works:

ICMP Protocol: Ping uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to send a message called an Echo Request to a target device. The target device then replies with an Echo Reply.

The primary purpose of this message exchange is to check whether the target device is reachable and how long it takes for data to travel from one device to another (also known as latency or ping time).
