7. **Malware Forensics**  
   Focuses on analyzing malicious software to determine its origin, intent, and impact.

## Stages in Digital Forensics Investigation

1. **Identification**  
   Identify potential evidence and determine the tools and techniques to recover it.

2. **Preservation**  
   Secure the evidence to prevent alteration or contamination. This involves creating bit-by-bit copies of storage devices and using write blockers.

3. **Collection**  
   Gather digital evidence systematically to ensure it remains admissible in court.

4. **Analysis**  
   Examine the evidence using forensic tools to extract meaningful insights. This includes recovering deleted files, analyzing timestamps, and correlating data.

5. **Documentation**  
   Record every step of the investigation, including how evidence was collected, stored, and analyzed.

6. **Reporting**  
   Provide a detailed report summarizing findings, methodologies, and conclusions.

7. **Presentation**  
   Present evidence and conclusions in court, ensuring clarity and compliance with legal standards.

3. **Intellectual Property Theft**  
   Identifying unauthorized use or theft of proprietary information.

4. **Employee Misconduct**  
   Investigating policy violations, such as unauthorized data access or sharing.

5. **Litigation Support**  
   Providing evidence and expert testimony in court cases.

## Legal Aspects of Digital Forensics

- **Admissibility of Evidence**  
   Evidence must be collected legally and without altering its original state. Chain of custody must be maintained.

- **Compliance with Laws**  
   Follow data protection and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

- **Expert Testimony**  
   Forensic investigators may need to present findings in court as expert witnesses.

## Best Practices in Digital Forensics
